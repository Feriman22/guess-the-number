# Guess the Number written in bash

"Guess the Game" game written in bash. The concept is very simple:

After startup, the script will randomly generate a number between 1 and 100. The game asks you what you think it is. Then 4 options are possible:

- If it's higher than the number the script "thinks" it is, it prints out that it's higher and asks again.
- If it is less than the script "thinks" it will print lower and ask again.
- If you hit it, it will tell you that you are good :)
- And it has error handling in case you enter the wrong number.

Update: The code has been optimized.
